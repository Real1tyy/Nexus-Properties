# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about Nexus Properties and their answers.

## General Questions

### What is Nexus Properties?

Nexus Properties is an Obsidian plugin that automatically manages bidirectional relationships (parent-child, related) and provides an interactive relationship graph to visualize and navigate your knowledge network.

### Is it free?

Yes! Nexus Properties is completely free and open source under the MIT license.

### Does it work on mobile?

The plugin is currently focused on desktop use. Mobile support is not guaranteed but may work with limitations.

### What's the difference between this and Obsidian's built-in graph?

Obsidian's graph shows backlinks. Nexus Properties shows **frontmatter-based relationships** with automatic bidirectional sync, multiple view modes, color rules, filtering, and zoom previews.

## Relationship Management

### Why use frontmatter relationships instead of backlinks?

- **Explicit structure**: Define clear parent-child hierarchies
- **Bidirectional sync**: Set once, updates both sides automatically
- **Typed relationships**: Distinguish between parent, child, and related
- **Queryable**: Filter and search based on relationship properties

### Can I use both backlinks and Nexus Properties?

Yes! They complement each other. Use backlinks for general references, Nexus Properties for structured relationships.

### What happens if I manually edit relationships in both files?

The plugin will sync them on next file change. However, it's best to let the plugin handle bidirectional sync automatically.

### Can I have multiple parents?

By default, a file can have one parent. If you need multiple, you can manually add them, but the plugin is designed for tree hierarchies (single parent).

### How do I break a relationship?

1. Delete the relationship from one file's frontmatter
2. Plugin automatically removes it from the other file
3. Or use context menu: Right-click edge ‚Üí "Remove Relationship"

## Graph Features

### Why isn't my file showing in the graph?

Check:
1. File is in an [indexed directory](configuration#directory-scanning)
2. File has relationships (`Parent`, `Child`, or `Related`)
3. Filters aren't hiding it
4. View mode is appropriate (Hierarchical vs Related)

### How do I see all my notes in the graph?

- Switch to "All Related" mode
- Ensure directories are scanned
- Clear any active filters
- Check that notes have relationships

### Can I customize the graph layout?

Layout is automatic, but you can:
- Manually drag nodes (positions not saved)
- Adjust view mode for different layouts
- Use filtering to focus on subsets
- Configure [animation duration](configuration#graph-animation-duration)

### How do I save the graph as an image?

Use standard screenshot tools (Snipping Tool, macOS screenshots, etc.) to capture the graph view.

## Performance

### The graph is slow with many notes. How can I improve it?

1. **Reduce recursion depth**: Lower [All Related Max Depth](configuration#all-related-recursion-depth)
2. **Limit directory scanning**: Only scan [relevant folders](configuration#directory-scanning)
3. **Disable animations**: Set [animation duration](configuration#graph-animation-duration) to 0ms
4. **Use filtering**: Show only [relevant nodes](features/filtering)
5. **Use "Start from Current"**: Focus on subtrees

### How many notes can the plugin handle?

- **Small vaults** (< 500 notes): Excellent performance
- **Medium vaults** (500-2000 notes): Good performance with optimizations
- **Large vaults** (2000+ notes): May require [performance tuning](#the-graph-is-slow-with-many-notes-how-can-i-improve-it)

### Does the plugin index my entire vault on startup?

Only files in [configured directories](configuration#directory-scanning) are indexed. Use specific directories to limit scope.

## Color Rules & Filtering

### My color rule isn't working. Why?

Check:
1. [Expression syntax](features/color-rules#expression-syntax) is valid JavaScript
2. Property names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Rule is [enabled](features/color-rules#enablingdisabling-rules)
4. Rule [order](features/color-rules#rule-order--priority) (first match wins)
5. Property exists in frontmatter (use [tooltips](features/tooltips) to verify)

### Can I have different colors for different note types?

Yes! Create color rules based on a `type` property:

```javascript
type === 'project'  // Blue
type === 'task'     // Green
type === 'note'     // Purple
```

[Learn more about color rules ‚Üí](features/color-rules)

### How do filters work with view modes?

Filters apply to all view modes. They hide nodes that don't match filter expressions, regardless of Hierarchical/Related/All Related mode.

### Can I save filter presets?

Yes! Use [Filter Presets](features/filtering#filter-presets) to save commonly-used filters with names for quick access.

## Node Creation

### Where are new nodes created?

New nodes are created in the **same folder** as the source file.

### Can I change where new nodes are created?

Not currently. Future versions may support template folders or configurable locations.

### Why is my property not being copied to new nodes?

Check [Excluded Properties](features/excluded-properties):
1. Property might be in [default exclusions](configuration#default-excluded-properties)
2. Property might be in [path-based exclusion rule](features/excluded-properties#path-based-exclusion-rules)

### What is a Zettel ID?

A unique timestamp-based identifier (`YYYYMMDDHHmmss`) assigned to each new node. Useful for Zettelkasten workflows and ensuring unique node IDs.

[Learn more ‚Üí](features/node-creation#zettel-id-generation)

### Can I disable Zettel ID generation?

Yes! Set the [Zettel ID property](configuration#zettel-id-property) to an empty string in settings.

## Zoom Mode

### What's the difference between Zoom Mode and Tooltips?

- **Tooltips**: Hover for quick property preview
- **Zoom Mode**: Click for full content preview with navigation

[Learn more ‚Üí](features/zoom-mode)

### Can I edit notes in Zoom Mode?

No, Zoom Mode is read-only preview. Double-click a node or use context menu ‚Üí "Open in New Tab" to edit.

### How do I exit Zoom Mode?

Click the focused node again, press Escape, or click outside the graph.

## Troubleshooting

### My relationships aren't syncing. What's wrong?

1. Check [directory scanning](configuration#directory-scanning) includes both files
2. Verify [property names](configuration#direct-relationship-properties) are correct
3. Use wiki link format: `[[note name]]`
4. Run [full rescan](configuration#indexing) to rebuild relationships

### The plugin broke after updating. How do I fix it?

1. **Check compatibility**: Ensure Obsidian is version 1.6.0+
2. **Reload plugin**: Settings ‚Üí Community plugins ‚Üí Reload
3. **Restart Obsidian**: Close and reopen completely
4. **Check console**: `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+I` for error messages
5. **Report issue**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Real1tyy/Nexus-Properties/issues)

### How do I reset all settings to defaults?

1. Close Obsidian
2. Navigate to `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/nexus-properties/`
3. Delete or rename `data.json`
4. Restart Obsidian

:::warning Data Loss
This resets ALL settings including color rules, filters, and exclusions. Export/backup settings first if needed.
:::

### Can I export/import settings?

Not directly through the UI. Advanced users can:
1. Copy `data.json` file between vaults
2. Manually edit JSON (at your own risk)

## Advanced Questions

### Can I use this with Dataview?

Yes! Relationships are stored in frontmatter, so Dataview can query them:

```dataview
LIST
WHERE Parent = [[Project Overview]]
```

### Can I use this with Templater?

Yes! New nodes inherit properties, which can include Templater templates or Templater-created properties.

### Does it work with Canvas?

Canvas notes are regular files. If they're in indexed directories with relationships, they'll appear in the graph.

### Can I script relationship creation?

Yes, for advanced users:
1. Modify frontmatter programmatically
2. Plugin will detect changes
3. Bidirectional sync happens automatically

Use `app.fileManager.processFrontMatter()` API.

### How does it handle file conflicts?

If two users edit relationships simultaneously (e.g., in synced vaults):
- Last write wins
- May cause temporary inconsistency
- Run [full rescan](configuration#indexing) to fix

## Migration & Compatibility

### Can I migrate from another system?

If your previous system used frontmatter properties:
1. Rename properties to match Nexus Properties names
2. Run [full rescan](configuration#indexing)
3. Relationships will be synced

### Will it work with my existing notes?

Yes! The plugin:
- Doesn't modify notes without relationships
- Only manages specified properties
- Won't break existing structure

### Can I uninstall without breaking my vault?

Yes! Relationships are stored as frontmatter. If you uninstall:
- Frontmatter remains
- Relationships still readable by humans
- You can reinstall later
- Or use another tool that reads frontmatter

### What happens to my relationships if I uninstall?

They remain in frontmatter. You can:
- Keep them for future use
- Remove manually if desired
- Use other tools that read frontmatter
