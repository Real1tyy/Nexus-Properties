# Changelog

All notable changes to Nexus Properties will be documented here.

## 1.1.0

### New Features

#### Keyboard Navigation in Zoom Mode
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Navigate between nodes using arrow keys while in zoom mode. Up/Down arrows follow parent-child relationships, Left/Right arrows move to spatially adjacent nodes.
- **Tree Navigation (Folder Notes)**: Press Enter to jump to the next tree root (right) and Shift+Enter to jump to the previous tree root (left) when viewing folder notes with multiple trees.
- **Smart Context Awareness**: Keyboard shortcuts only work in zoom mode and are disabled when typing in search/filter inputs.

#### Custom Sorting for Bases View
- **Custom Formulas**: Define formulas that map property values to numeric priorities for advanced sorting.
- **Flexible Sort Rules**: Configure multi-level sorting using formulas and built-in properties (e.g., sort by status, then priority, then modification time).
- **Easy Configuration**: Settings provide text areas where you enter YAML content that gets dynamically embedded into base code blocks.
