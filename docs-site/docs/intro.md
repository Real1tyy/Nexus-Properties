# Nexus Properties

**Nexus Properties** is a powerful Obsidian plugin that automatically manages bidirectional property relationships and provides an interactive relationship graph visualization. It helps you build and navigate complex knowledge networks by maintaining consistent parent-child and related relationships across your vault.

## What is Nexus Properties?

Nexus Properties transforms your Obsidian vault into an interconnected knowledge graph by:

- **Automatically syncing bidirectional relationships** - When you set a child, the parent is automatically updated
- **Computing recursive relationships** - Visualize entire hierarchies and related constellations
- **Providing an interactive graph view** - Navigate your knowledge network visually
- **Maintaining consistency** - Automatic cleanup when files are deleted or relationships change

## Key Features
