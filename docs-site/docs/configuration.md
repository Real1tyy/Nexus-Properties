---

## Property Display

Configure how properties are displayed in tooltips, previews, and zoom mode.

### Hide Empty Properties

**Default**: `true`

Hide properties with empty, null, or undefined values in tooltips and previews.

**Enabled**: Only properties with values are shown
**Disabled**: All properties are shown, even if empty

### Hide Underscore Properties

**Default**: `true`

Hide properties that start with an underscore (`_`) in tooltips and previews.

Useful for hiding internal/system properties like `_ZettelID`.

### Zoom: Hide Frontmatter by Default

**Default**: `false`

When entering zoom preview, frontmatter section starts hidden by default.

You can still toggle frontmatter visibility using the eye icon.

### Zoom: Hide Content by Default

**Default**: `false`

When entering zoom preview, file content starts hidden by default.

You can still toggle content visibility using the eye icon.

---

## Node Colors

Configure the visual appearance of nodes in the graph.

### Default Node Color

**Default**: `#e9f2ff` (light blue)

Default color for nodes when no color rules match. Can be any valid CSS color:
- Hex: `#3b82f6`
- HSL: `hsl(200, 70%, 50%)`
- Named: `steelblue`

### Color Rules

Define conditional colors based on frontmatter properties. Rules are evaluated in order - the first matching rule determines the node color.

Each rule has:
- **Expression** - JavaScript expression that returns true/false
- **Color** - CSS color to apply when expression matches
- **Enabled** - Toggle to enable/disable the rule
- **Order** - Use ↑/↓ buttons to reorder rules

**Example Rules**:

| Expression | Color | Description |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| `Status === 'Active'` | `#22c55e` (green) | Active nodes |
| `type === 'project'` | `#3b82f6` (blue) | Project nodes |
| `Priority === 'High'` | `#ef4444` (red) | High priority |
| `Array.isArray(tags) && tags.includes('important')` | `#f59e0b` (orange) | Important tags |

---

## Graph Filtering

Configure how nodes can be filtered in the graph view.

### Filter Expressions

Show only nodes (and their edges) whose frontmatter matches ALL expressions. Each line should be a JavaScript expression returning true/false.

Access frontmatter properties directly by name. The source node is always shown.

**Example Expressions**:

```javascript
Status === 'Active'
type === 'project'
Array.isArray(tags) && tags.includes('important')
```

Changes apply on blur or `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`.

[Learn more about Filtering →](features/filtering)

### Filter Presets

Create named filter presets for quick access in the graph. Use the command "Toggle Graph Filter (Preset Selector)" to show a dropdown with your presets.

Each preset has:
- **Name** - Display name (e.g., "Active Tasks", "Projects")
- **Expression** - Filter expression to apply

Selecting a preset fills the filter expression input.

---

## Indexing

### Index and Assign Properties to All Files

Manually scan all files in your vault and assign relationship properties based on your configured settings.

This process will:
1. Scan all files in configured directories
2. Update their frontmatter with bidirectional relationships
3. Compute recursive relationships
4. Clean up orphaned relationships

**When to use**:
- After changing property names
- After enabling the plugin for the first time
- When relationships seem out of sync
- After bulk importing notes

:::warning Large Vaults
This operation may take some time for vaults with thousands of files. Progress is logged to the console.
:::

---

## Directory Scanning

Configure which directories to scan for files with relationships.

**Default**: `["*"]` (scan all directories)

### Options

- **`*`** - Scan all directories in the vault
- **Specific paths** - Only scan specified directories and their subdirectories

**Examples**:

| Configuration | What Gets Scanned |
|---------------|-------------------|
| `["*"]` | Entire vault |
| `["Projects"]` | Only `Projects/` and subdirectories |
| `["Projects", "Notes/Work"]` | Both directories and subdirectories |

### Adding Directories

1. Enter a directory path (e.g., `Projects` or `Notes/Work`)
2. Click "Add"
3. The directory and all its subdirectories will be scanned

:::tip Wildcard Behavior
When you add a specific directory, `"*"` is automatically removed. To scan all directories again, use the "Scan all" quick action.
:::

### Quick Actions

- **Reset to scan all directories** - Clears all specific directories and scans the entire vault

---

## Direct Relationship Properties

Configure property names for direct bidirectional relationships.

:::info Bidirectional Sync
When you set a relationship in one direction, the plugin automatically updates the reverse relationship.
:::

### Parent Property

**Default**: `Parent`

Property name for parent reference (bidirectional with children).

**Example**:
```yaml
# child-note.md
Parent: "[[parent-note]]"
```

### Children Property

**Default**: `Child`

Property name for children references (bidirectional with parent).

**Example**:
```yaml
# parent-note.md
Child:
  - "[[child-note-1]]"
  - "[[child-note-2]]"
```

### Related Property

**Default**: `Related`

Property name for related files (bidirectional - automatically syncs between linked files).

**Example**:
```yaml
# note-1.md
Related:
  - "[[note-2]]"
  - "[[note-3]]"
```

### Auto-Link Siblings

**Default**: `true`

Automatically mark nodes as related when they share the same parent (siblings are related to each other).

**Enabled**: Siblings automatically get related relationships
**Disabled**: Only explicitly defined related relationships exist

---

## Node Creation Shortcuts

Configure how new nodes are created using command palette shortcuts.

### Zettel ID Property

**Default**: `_ZettelID`

Property name for unique timestamp identifier assigned to new nodes.

Format: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` (e.g., `20250125143022`)

### How It Works

When you use commands like "Create Child Node":

1. New node is created in the same folder as the source file
2. All frontmatter properties are inherited (except excluded properties)
3. A new Zettel ID is generated automatically
4. Bidirectional relationships are established automatically
5. Commands are only available for files in indexed directories

---

## Excluded Properties

Configure which frontmatter properties should NOT be copied when creating new nodes.

### Default Excluded Properties

**Default**: `["Parent", "Child", "Related", "_ZettelID"]`

Comma-separated list of properties to ALWAYS exclude from copying. These are excluded regardless of any path-based rules.

**Common exclusions**:
- Relationship properties: `Parent`, `Child`, `Related`
- System properties: `_ZettelID`, `_CreatedDate`
- File-specific: `date`, `created`, `modified`

### Path-Based Exclusion Rules

Define rules to exclude ADDITIONAL properties for files in specific directories. The default excluded properties are always excluded. Rules are evaluated in order - the first matching path's properties are ADDED to the default exclusion list.

Each rule has:
- **Path** - Directory path (uses `startsWith` matching)
- **Excluded Properties** - Comma-separated properties to exclude
- **Enabled** - Toggle to enable/disable the rule
- **Order** - Use ↑/↓ buttons to reorder rules

**Example Rules**:

| Path | Excluded Properties | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| `Projects/` | `status, progress` | Don't copy status/progress for projects |
| `Daily Notes/2024/` | `date, weekday` | Don't copy date fields from daily notes |
| `Templates/` | `template-version` | Don't copy template metadata |

:::warning Path Matching
Path matching uses `startsWith` - a file matches if its path starts with the rule's path. Default excluded properties are ALWAYS excluded. Path rules ADD additional properties to exclude.
:::

## Hotkeys

You can assign custom hotkeys to any Nexus Properties command in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings.

### Recommended Hotkeys

| Command | Suggested Hotkey | Description |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Show Relationship Graph | `Ctrl+Shift+G` | Open/toggle graph view |
| Toggle Graph Search | `Ctrl+K` | Show/hide search bar |
| Toggle Graph Filter | `Ctrl+F` | Show/hide filter input |
| Enlarge Graph | `Ctrl+Shift+E` | Enlarge/restore graph |
| Create Child Node | `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Create child of current file |
| Create Parent Node | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | Create parent of current file |
| Create Related Node | `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Create related to current file |

To set hotkeys:
1. Open Settings → Hotkeys
2. Search for "Nexus Properties"
3. Click the `+` icon next to a command
4. Press your desired key combination

---

## Performance Tips

For large vaults with thousands of files:

1. **Limit directory scanning** - Only scan folders you need
2. **Reduce recursion depth** - Lower "All Related" and "Hierarchy" depth limits
3. **Disable animations** - Set animation duration to 0ms
4. **Use filter expressions** - Show only relevant nodes
5. **Hide tooltips** - Disable tooltips if you don't need them
6. **Limit displayed properties** - Keep "Display properties in nodes" empty or minimal

---

## Resetting Settings

To reset all settings to defaults:

1. Open Settings → Nexus Properties
2. Close Obsidian completely
3. Navigate to `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/nexus-properties/`
4. Delete or rename `data.json`
5. Restart Obsidian

The plugin will regenerate default settings on next load.
